  - UEFI memory map processing and statistics display

- **Interrupt Handling**
  - Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) with 256 entries
  - Basic interrupt handlers (divide by zero, breakpoint, timer, keyboard)
  - PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) configuration and remapping
  - Interrupt enabling with STI instruction
  - Foundation for responsive kernel operations

- **AI Text Analysis System**
